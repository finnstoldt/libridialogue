# LibriDialogue

This repository contains the generation script for the _LibriDialogue_ dataset.
The dataset is generated by simulating conversations between two speakers using the LibriSpeech dataset in virtual reverberant rooms.
The conversations are generated by sampling random utterances from the LibriSpeech dataset and concatenating them together.
The dataset is intended to be used to test crosstalk cancellation algorithms in the context of speech enhancement and transcription.

The repository also contains the separation script used to generate the separated signals from the mixed signals based on different crosstalk cancellation algorithms.

## Configuration

The configuration file `config.yaml` contains the parameters used to generate the dataset.
In this file the dataset locations as well as the generation parameters can be set.

## Generating the dataset

To setup the project, first install the required packages by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

Then, generate the dataset by running:

```bash
poetry run main
```
